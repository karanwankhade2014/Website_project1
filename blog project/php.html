                <pre>

                    PHP is mostly used for making web servers. It runs on the browser and 
                    is also capable of running in the command line. So, if you don't feel like
                     showing your code output in the browser, you can show it in the terminal.

                    PHP runs on the Zend engine, which is the most popular implementation. 
                    There are some other implementations as well, like parrot, 
                    HPVM (Hip Hop Virtual Machine), and Hip Hop, created by Facebook.


                    it is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system
                     on the web (WordPress)!
                   It is deep enough to run large social networks!
                  It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language!

                <pre>

                    jPHP is a server-side scripting language embedded in HTML in its simplest form.
                     PHP allows web developers to create dynamic content and interact with databases.
                      PHP is known for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility — features that have
                       made it a cornerstone in the web development world. We respect your privacy.

                       Its main ability is to generate the dynamic page content. 
                       PHP as all backend languages is responsible for business logic. 
                       Moreover, it has the capability to collect data, set, and receive cookies.
                        Also, PHP gives the ability to change, update or delete data in the database,
                         set user access to this data, and encrypt it.

        <h2>3.PHP use</h2>
        <p class="p-4">
           1. Server-side scripting
            Server-side Script is PHP’s main strength. If you are just learning to code and want to explore server-side
            scripting, PHP is a great language to learn. To get cracking with PHP server-side scripting you’ll need to
            have a PHP parser, web server and web browser.
           2. Command-line scripting
            Command-line scripting is ideal for scripts made using cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows). It is also
            great for simple text processing.
            3.Writing desktop applications
            PHP is probably not the best language to use to create desktop applications but for the advanced web
            developer, it provides you with many more options than its competitors.
