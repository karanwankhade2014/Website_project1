        <p class="p-4 text-justify">A programming language is a set of instructions written by a programmer to deliver
            instructions to the computer to perform and accomplish a task. This set of instructions is usually viewed as
            incomprehensible code structured following a definite programming language syntax.

            Gaining a job in the IT industry is easy and also quite tough. You will need to possess both technical and
            non-technical skills. In terms of technical, the first and foremost skill any aspirant looking for a place
            in tech must acquire is the mastery of programming languages.

            Whether a newbie or a tech student, you might have already heard about programming languages. However, you
            need to know that the term ‘programming languages’ is abstract. There are various programming languages you
            may and may not have heard of, and each is categorised under different categories.

            Instead of jumping on to learn a programming language which is in demand, read this article to learn
            in-depth about programming languages and choose the one which sparks interest in you.

        </h3>


        <p class="p-4 text-justify">Many languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, combined
            with other languages, and eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one
            "universal" computer language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be accepted in this role.
            The need for diverse computer languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:

            Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of
            programmers.
            Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be
            comfortable with considerable complexity.
            Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to
            supercomputers.
            Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo nearly constant
            modification.
            Finally, programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and
            expressing them in a particular language.

        <p class="p-4 text-justify">A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1]
            Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind
            of computer language.

            The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
            semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a
            specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other
            languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have
            both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation
            being common.
