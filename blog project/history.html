                    The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to
                    modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying
                    on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.[1] Throughout the 20th century, research in
                    compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible
                    syntax to communicate instructions.

                    The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and
                    1945.[2] The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in
                    1951, for his PhD thesis.[3] The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula
                    TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a
                    team led by John Backus at IBM

                    Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based
                    technologies. Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions.

                    Programming enables people to solve practical problems by breaking them down into a series of
                    logical steps, known as algorithms or programs. Application developers can use any number of
                    programming languages to write applications for specific kinds of computers, like supercomputers,
                    laptops, and smartphone

        <h2>3.our future</h2>
        <p class="p-4">
            The rise of artificial intelligence and automation will have a profound impact on coding jobs in the coming
            decades. But with the right skills and attitudes, coders of all backgrounds can still find rewarding work
            amid this rapid change.

            With the demand for technology skills rapidly growing across all industries, the ability to code is no
            longer just a valuable asset but an essential one. Coding is a great skill on its own, but it can even
            enhance your existing skills such as writing or marketing.</p>
