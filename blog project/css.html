                <pre>
                   1. CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. 
                    2.CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML).
                     3.This language contains coding elements and is composed of these
                      “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files (. css).

                <pre>
                    CSS helps you to keep the informational content of a document separate
                     from the details of how to display it. 
                     The details of how to display the document are known as its style. 
                     You keep the style separate from the content so that you can:

                    1.Avoid duplication
                    2.Make maintenance easier
                    3.Use the same content with different styles for different purposes

        <h2>3.CSS use</h2>
        <p class="p-4">
            CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which
            is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML
            to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.

            It is easier to make the web pages presentable using CSS. It is easy to learn and understand and used to
            control the presentation of an HTML document. CSS helps us to control the text color, font style, the
            spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more. It is independent of HTML, and
            we can use it with any XML-based markup language.

            It is recommended to use CSS because the HTML attributes are being deprecated. So, for making HTML pages
            compatible with future browsers, it is good to start using CSS in HTML pages.
