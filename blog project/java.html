                <pre>
                    Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform
                     that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices,
                      gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax 
                      of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.

                    One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability.
                     Once you have written code for a Java program on a notebook computer, 
                     it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device. 
                     When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems 
                     (later acquired by Oracle),
                      the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
                    
                    It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript.
                     Javascript does not need to be compiled, while Java code does need to be compiled.
                      Also, Javascript only runs on web browsers while Java can be run anywhere

                <h2 class="text-center">2.Why JAVA</h2>
                <pre>

                    java is a secure and reliable language, also easy to learn and use. 
                    It also offers powerful features such as object-oriented programming,
                     garbage collection, platform independence, and a wide range of libraries and APIs.
                     Java is used to build applications and platforms for a number of devices, 
                     including computers, laptops, gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, 
                     car navigation systems, medical monitoring devices, parking meters,
                      lottery terminals and smartphones. It is also a key language for networking, 
                      particularly for data centers that store and transfer Web-based data.

        <h2>3.JAVA use</h2>
        <p class="p-4">
            Companies across the globe use Java to build the applications and websites they offer their consumers.
            Learning this programming language means youâ€™ve completed one of the prerequisites that could qualify you
            for a career in software or app development.

            Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language (OOP). It is not to be confused with
            JavaScript, a scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. Due to its reliability and ease of use,
            Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It's likely to be one of the first
            programming languages you encounter as an aspiring application developer.

            A significant benefit to Java is the wide range of tasks it can be used to perform. It is highly beneficial
            for tasks and projects requiring both high performance and quick turnaround. Here are a few of the most
            common tasks for which Java is best suited:

            Building and running mobile applications

            Building and scaling cloud applications

            Developing chatbots and other marketing tools

            Powering enterprise-level web applications

            Supporting artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) devices
