                   1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                   2. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                   3. HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                   4. HTML consists of a series of elements
                   5. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                   6. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading",
                    "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

                    What are the Benefits of Using HTML in Web Pages? 
                    When creating a website, HTML is the foundation that holds all
                     the content and design elements together. 
                     It gives structure to the web page, defining things like headings,
                      paragraphs, and links. Without HTML, a web page would just
                       be a jumbled mess of text and images.

        <p class="p-4">

            HTML is a markup language used to create web pages and applications. When combined with JavaScript and CSS, HTML
            has become a milestone for web development. One useful aspect of HTML is that it can embed programs written
            in a scripting language like JavaScript, which is responsible for affecting the behavior and content of web
            pages. CSS inclusion would affect the layout and appearance of the content. The basic building blocks of any
            HTML page are HTML elements. You can create a structured document using structural-semantic text such as
            headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and other items. Browser indeed does not display the HTML tags but
            utilizes them to interpret the pages content. One needs to study various tags and then understand their
            behavior.

            Web developers use HTML for creating web documents, internet navigation, and more. In this Uses of HTML
            article, we shall focus on the top USes of HTML.
